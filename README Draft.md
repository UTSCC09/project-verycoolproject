## Project Description

**Task:** ActItOut is an online web application that makes Charades online and accessible to anyone from anywhere. Players will act out words or phrases using live video from their device, and everyone else playing will try to guess the word through the live chat. The platform supports multiplayer with 
private rooms, live chat, and the ability to configure their game settings and word sets.

## Development

**Task:** Leaving deployment aside, explain how the app is built. Please describe the overall code design and be specific about the programming languages, framework, libraries and third-party api that you have used. 

The app was builting using the MERN stack. We used socket.io to communicate between server and clients to support real-time messaging, and used PeerJS as
our WebRTC api to connect video streams together.

## Deployment

**Task:** Explain how you have deployed your application. 

## Challenges

**Task:** What is the top 3 most challenging things that you have learned/developed for you app? Please restrict your answer to only three items. 

1. Live messaging using socket.io
2. Live video streaming with on-demand switching
3. Game logic - including guessing mechanics, room management, score system, timer system, player system, and synchronization between clients to prevent race-conditions
