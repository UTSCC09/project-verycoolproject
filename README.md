## Top 5 Technical Challenges:
1. **Real-time Video Streaming:** Implementing live video streaming between multiple users

2. **Multiple Room**: Creating a "room" system for various different games to occur at the same time. Each room are drop-in, available to those with the access code. The system should be able to support several rooms with users.

3. **Live-Chat**:  Developing a live-chat system for users to message each other in, seeing live feedback from other users as well. This live-chat would be implemented for each "room", and all users in the room can access it.

4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensuring the app works across both mobile (iOS and Android) as well as desktop.

5. **Security**: Ensuring the security of users, as they will be live connected in the "room", as well as security for live-videos.
